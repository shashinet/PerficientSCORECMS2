# Setting up the front end code

The front end code for the site is maintained in the **frontend-web** directory under the source root. Prior to the first build the npm packages for the front end code should be installed and the build process for the front end should be validated.

Complete the following to install and build the front end code.

- Navigate to the **frontend-web** directory in PowerShell.
- Run the command **npm ci** - this will download the npm packages.
- If there are issues with the **npm ci** command then try running **npm install**
- Run the command **npm run build:Perficient** - this command will run the build process for the front end code for the main web property.
